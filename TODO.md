# TODO List

## General / All Images

- Experiment with multi-stage builds.
- Make test for setup-image.sh
- Add builds for Reddis
- Add builds for Haproxy
- Add builds for Python
- Add builds for Ruby
- Add builds for Node.js
- Add builds for Php-Litespeed
- Create full-stack builds (ex. LEMP) with support for common web frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony, Django, and Rails.
- Consider removing install from repo entirely (exception Alpine).

## Php-Nginx Images

- Compile all shared libraries from source, instead of relying on OS development packages. This will standardize compile builds across distributions and is more wholesome.

## Mariadb Images

- Add ability to compile from source.
